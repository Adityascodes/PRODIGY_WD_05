Hello Everyone!!

I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of my Task-05 at Prodigy InfoTech - Weather WebApp using weather API.

It uses API of openweathermap.org.

user can see weather and temperature detail of any city around the world!

I had used HTML for structuring the website, CSS to style it and JAVASCRIPT for interacting functionality.
